# dotnet-core-api-seed
DotNetCoreApiSeed is a very simple a[[ that you can understand,use its structure and edit its content to satisfy your business logic and workflow.

DotNetCoreApiSeed app built dotnet core, entity framework core, postgres database.

It use dependency injection technique to respond to users requests.

it can be easly used and pluged in any solution or projects, and get connected with the frontend.

Not a big thing but it seems helpful if you want to build your app from scratch, and a good experience for me that I would like to share.
